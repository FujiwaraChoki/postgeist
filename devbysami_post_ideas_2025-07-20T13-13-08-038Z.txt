1. Day 5/âˆž until $1k/MRR


2. Building in public is hard but it forces you to show up. That consistency changes everything.


3. Trying to get LLMs to follow specific JSON schema is still an uphill battle. One small slip and it just starts hallucinating random fields. Infuriating.


4. If you're a founder and you're not posting daily on X, you're leaving so much on the table. It's the best distribution channel out there, hands down.


5. Just shipped an update to Postel that drastically reduces initial data fetching time. Every millisecond counts for that first impression. Users deserve snappy apps.


6. The hardest part about building a solo SaaS isn't the code, it's the constant mental battle to stay disciplined and keep pushing when nobody's watching.


7. What's one thing you wish you knew before starting your first paid product? Mine was 'pricing is an art, not a science'. ðŸ¤”


8. Bun's recent update with hot module reloading is a game changer for local dev. So much faster to iterate on changes. Huge shoutout to @bunjavascript team.


9. Crazy to think how much can change in a year. From the 9-5 grind to full-time building my own thing. The freedom to build on your terms is priceless.


10. For anyone struggling with content creation on X, you should really check out @postel_app. We're constantly adding new AI features to make posting easier. Seriously, give it a try!
